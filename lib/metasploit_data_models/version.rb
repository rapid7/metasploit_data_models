module MetasploitDataModels
  # MetasploitDataModels follows the {Semantic Versioning Specification http://semver.org/}.  At this time, the API
  # is considered unstable because the database migrations are still in metasploit-framework and certain models may not
  # be shared between metasploit-framework and pro, so models may be removed in the future.  Because of the unstable API
  # the version should remain below 1.0.0
  VERSION = '0.3.0'
